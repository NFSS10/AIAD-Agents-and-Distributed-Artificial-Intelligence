## Objective
Implement a Multi-Agent System that can simulate fire fighting over a terrain with certain characteristics. The Firefighting agents whose behaviors are guided by beliefs, desires and intentions (BDI).

To simplify the scenario, the environmental characteristics that influence the spread of fire are only the wind (direction and speed) and vegetation (fire propagates faster in denser vegetation).

Agents can move in all directions and extinguish the fire by throwing water over the burning elements. Agents can communicate with each other and rescue people in distress.
